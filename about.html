                        <p>
                            I'm a dedicated and passionate individual currently pursuing a degree in Computer Programming Technology at Humber Polytechnic.
                            I have hands-on experience with web development technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am continuously expanding my knowledge in this ever-evolving field.
                            My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that make a positive impact while furthering my expertise in front-end development.
